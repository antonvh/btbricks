# Development Guide

## Overview

btbricks is a MicroPython Bluetooth library for controlling LEGO hubs and creating custom BLE peripherals. Development involves both regular Python (for documentation, testing stubs, and package distribution) and MicroPython (for actual deployment).

## Key next steps. Please fork and help us out!

1. Right now the BLEHandler has code in the IRQ handler for setting up and receiving new connection. Depending on the state, e.g. connecting_uart=True, it executes one or the other. This should be refactored such that the connect_uart() method sets the correct callbacks in the IRQ and IRQ only handles callbacks. It's big change with lots of testing involved.
2. Everything is a monolithic file. For memory purposes it is probably better to split it, according to the
   mciropython-lib guidelines.

## Setting Up Development Environment

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher (for development tools, docs, and testing)
- MicroPython board (ESP32, LEGO SPIKE, etc.) for actual testing
- Git
- Virtual environment (venv)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/btbricks.git
    cd btbricks
    ```

2. Create and activate virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. Install development dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -e ".[dev]"
    ```

## Building Documentation

We use Sphinx with autodoc to generate API documentation from docstrings.

### Build HTML docs

```bash
cd docs
make html
```

Documentation will be in `docs/_build/html/`. Open `index.html` in a browser.

### Clean build

```bash
make clean
make html
```

### View documentation locally

```bash
open _build/html/index.html  # macOS
# or use your preferred browser
```

## Code Quality

### Format code with black

```bash
black btbricks tests
```

### Lint with flake8

```bash
flake8 btbricks tests
```

### Type check with mypy

```bash
mypy btbricks
```

## Testing

### Notes on Testing

Since btbricks is MicroPython-only, traditional unit tests are limited. Full testing requires:

- Running code directly on MicroPython device
- Testing with actual LEGO hubs or mock BLE devices

### Test stubs (if present)

```bash
pytest tests/
```

## Deploying to MicroPython Devices

### Using mpremote (for ESP32, SPIKE)

```bash
mpremote cp -r btbricks :btbricks
```

### Manual upload via WebREPL or Thonny

1. Copy `btbricks/` folder to device's filesystem
2. Ensure the module is in the Python path

### Verify installation

On the device REPL:

```python
import btbricks
print(btbricks.__version__)
```

## Building and Publishing Package

### Build distribution files

```bash
pip install build twine
python -m build
```

### Test PyPI upload (optional)

```bash
twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
```

### Upload to PyPI

```bash
twine upload dist/*
```
